## Repo for Recalls and Safety optimization protoyping project 

2018-11-15 - New repo based on [gc-proto/recalls-safety](https://github.com/gc-proto/recalls-safety)

A collaboration between TBS Digital Transformation Office, Health Canada, CFIA, Transport, Environment Canada

This repo holds a prototyped version of a new Mobile-1st design for Recalls and search/filter tools to improve citizen success. The search engine design and algorithms are hosted on Canada.ca search.  An initial baseline round of task-scenario testing on the live version of RSAMS (Recalls Safety Alerts Message System) highlighted critical usability problems that we improved in these prototypes of a potential new design. A second round of validation testing with a different set of Canadian participants on their smartphones took place in June 2018. Significant improvements in task success support this new approach.  

The design in Mobile 1st because the vast majority of people visiting recalls, particularly food recalls (89% mobile in June 2018) are viewing the web pages on their mobile phone. The search and filtering design is specificially designed to support using filters and search from a phone, while still keeping search results close by on the page.

See Australia's Recalls site for a model of a search-filtering system with simplified templates for the recalls. We refined this model to better support search and filtering on a mobile phone:
